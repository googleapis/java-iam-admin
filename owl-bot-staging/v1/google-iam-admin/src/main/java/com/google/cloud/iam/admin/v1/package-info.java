 * <p>======================= IAMClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Creates and manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.
 *
 * <p>You can use this service to work with all of the following resources:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> &#42;&#42;Service accounts&#42;&#42;, which identify an application or a virtual machine
 *       (VM) instance rather than a person
 *   <li> &#42;&#42;Service account keys&#42;&#42;, which service accounts use to authenticate with
 *       Google APIs
 *   <li> &#42;&#42;IAM policies for service accounts&#42;&#42;, which specify the roles that a
 *       member has for the service account
 *   <li> &#42;&#42;IAM custom roles&#42;&#42;, which help you limit the number of permissions that
 *       you grant to members
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, you can use this service to complete the following tasks, among others:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Test whether a service account can use specific permissions
 *   <li> Check which roles you can grant for a specific resource
 *   <li> Lint, or validate, condition expressions in an IAM policy
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Sample for IAMClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (IAMClient iAMClient = IAMClient.create()) {
 *   ServiceAccountName name = ServiceAccountName.of("[PROJECT]", "[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]");
 *   ServiceAccount response = iAMClient.getServiceAccount(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
